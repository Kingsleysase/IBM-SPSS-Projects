## Project Overview

As a public health enthusiast, I conducted this research to assess how well Nigerian university students understand HIV/AIDS. Despite nationwide awareness campaigns, misconceptions still persist, especially in treatment, prevention, and viral transmission.

I surveyed **203 students from 20+ states**, using a structured questionnaire and analyzed the data with SPSS. This research aimed to highlight key gaps, what influences knowledge accuracy, and how to fix it.

## Objectives & Research Questions

**Goal:** To assess knowledge accuracy and propose data-driven improvements.

**Specific Objectives:**
- Measure students’ actual vs. perceived knowledge
- Identify common misconceptions
- Analyze demographic and source-based influence on knowledge
- Offer actionable solutions

**Core Questions:**
- What do students know and misunderstand about HIV/AIDS?
- Does age, gender, or location affect accuracy?
- Which information sources make the most difference?

---

## Methodology

- **Design:** Quantitative, cross-sectional survey  
- **Sample Size Target:** 384 (203 reached)  
- **Sampling:** Convenience via social media & WhatsApp  
- **Instrument:** Survey CTO & Google Forms (validated through a 30-student pilot)  
- **Analysis Tools:** SPSS & Excel  
- **Statistical Methods:** Chi-square, t-tests, Pearson correlation (α = 0.05)

---

## Key Findings

### Demographics:
- **Female respondents:** 63.5%
- **Urban participants:** 75%
- **Leading state:** Kano (36.5%)

### Knowledge Strengths:
- 96.6% knew HIV is transmitted through unprotected sex  
- 94.6% correctly ruled out mosquitoes  
- 89.7% understood syringe transmission

### Knowledge Gaps:
- Only 58.1% knew HIV is incurable  
- 43.3% understood PrEP usage  
- 28.6% falsely believed HIV is curable  
- 22.7% unaware of mother-to-child transmission

### Information Source Impact:
- **Health institutions** were the **only source** with a statistically significant positive impact on knowledge (p = 0.001)
- **Schools (85% usage)** showed no correlation with better knowledge (p = 0.407)

---

## Insights & Interpretation

1. **Demographics don't matter—source does.** Age, gender, or geography didn’t significantly predict knowledge accuracy.
2. **Students trust schools the most, but schools don’t improve accuracy.**  
3. **Health institutions = most effective source.** Students who engaged them scored **0.88 points higher**.
4. **False confidence is dangerous.** 83% believed they were knowledgeable, yet critical misconceptions persisted.
5. **Social media & family sources are unreliable.**

## Recommendations

### Short-term (0–6 months)
- **Partner universities with health institutions** for verified outreach programs
- **Audit & improve HIV/AIDS content** in school curricula immediately
- **Social media strategy** to correct common myths using bite-sized visual content

### Medium-term (6–18 months)
- Launch **anti-stigma campaigns** on campuses
- Build **digital info hubs** in local languages
- Create **student-led peer education programs**

### Long-term (18+ months)
- Support **family-based HIV/AIDS education**
- Develop **multilingual public health materials**
- Set up **institutional health literacy monitoring frameworks**

---

## Limitations & Future Research

- **Sample bias** due to convenience sampling
- **Underrepresentation of rural students**
- **No behavioral observation** (knowledge ≠ behavior)
- Future work should explore **longitudinal trends**, **qualitative interviews**, and **policy impact** assessments.

---

## Conclusion

This research uncovered serious HIV/AIDS knowledge gaps among Nigerian university students, with **demographics proving irrelevant**, and **health institutions emerging as the strongest knowledge drivers**.

I believe this study offers a solid, data-driven foundation for meaningful HIV/AIDS awareness reform in Nigerian higher institutions. My ultimate recommendation is to **strengthen health-institution involvement in education, and redesign school curricula to reflect scientific accuracy.**
